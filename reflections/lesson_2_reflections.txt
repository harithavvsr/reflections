What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	a normal directory becomes git directory by adding a metadata directory .git 
	we need it to access git features i.e. version controlling
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	staging area lies between working directory and repository. we can add select files to this area and then commit them to the repository.
